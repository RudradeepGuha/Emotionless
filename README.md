# Emotionless
A deep learning model for facial expression recognition in images.

A Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify facial expressions into one of 7 classes: Neutral, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Sad, Happy and Surprise.

The final training accuracy obtained till now is 78% while the test accuracy is 46%. 

Using Keras with TensorFlow backend. Model built from scratch (no pre-trained network used).
